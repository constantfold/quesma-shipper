# Scrub performance

How this package went from 1.84 to ~72 MB/s (36-41x) on real Claude Code
transcripts with byte-identical redaction, what must stay true to keep it there,
and the approaches that were tried and refuted, so they are not re-litigated.

All throughput figures are strictly serial runs of `BenchmarkScrubRealData`
over one frozen 256.7 MiB snapshot of `~/.claude/projects` (131 .jsonl files,
M1 Max). The corpus was snapshotted because the live tree changes mid-run, and
runs were serial because concurrent load once skewed a measurement by 40%.

## Throughput by stage

| Stage (commit) | MB/s | vs baseline | Allocated per pass |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| baseline (e3d3f61) | 1.84 | 1.0x | 10.1 GB / 28.5M allocs |
| + allocation diet on the JSONL walk (4a10b3c) | 2.25 | 1.2x | 3.3 GB / 8.7M |
| + one keyword automaton for the rule ladder (14db7a4) | 6.7 | 3.6x | 3.0 GB / 7.7M |
| + the ladder stops running regexes it does not need (8275fcf) | 28.5 | 15.5x | 3.0 GB / 7.7M |
| + hand JSON tokenizer, fused PII pass, entropy scoring (6a85aee) | 66.9-78.8 | 36-41x | 1.74 GB / 1.34M |

## Why it was slow

The baseline profile was 75% regexp execution. Three compounding causes:

- The keyword prefilter (`containsAny`) lowercased the whole value once per
  rule, about 29 times per value.
- The key-name matcher ran a 19-way `(?i)` alternation over every value with
  no prefilter: 34% of total CPU by itself.
- Go's `regexp` guarantees linear time but runs a Pike VM: cost per byte is
  proportional to the number of live NFA states. It has no lazy DFA, which is
  the machine that makes C++ RE2, Rust's regex and Hyperscan fast.

## Current implementation

One precomputed Aho-Corasick DFA over every rule's ASCII-folded keywords plus
the key-name stems scans each value once (`packs/prefilter.go`); rules whose
keywords did not fire never run. Typed nodes hold transitions and outputs directly;
construction fills missing edges through failure links, without alphabet remapping
or packed state/output flags. Rules that do fire mostly avoid the regexp engine
anyway: card-pan, pesel, iban and email are hand byte-scanners
(`packs/pii.go`, `packs/handscan.go`), and the remaining rules are matched by
literal anchoring (`packs/anchor.go`): memchr to occurrences of the corpus
`keywords`, confirm with a `\A`-anchored regex. Dispatch order is hand scanner,
then anchored, then linear sweep; rules with interior keywords or known
anchoring cost cliffs declare `"sweep": true`.
The JSONL walk uses Go's `encoding/json/jsontext` decoder and records edits
against the original bytes (`jsonwalk.go`). Only changed strings are quoted
again; unchanged fields, whitespace and line endings are copied verbatim.
Duplicate names and invalid UTF-8 retain encoding/json v1 acceptance.

Entropy candidates use a narrow histogram and the calibrated Shannon sum in
ascending byte order. There is one scoring formula: no approximate score,
rounding band, precomputed logarithm table or distinct-symbol rejection floor.
The grid scan still skips short runs; independent byte-walk and wide-histogram
references check candidates, exact scores and threshold decisions.

Keyword matching folds ASCII letter bytes and nothing else; Unicode runes
that lowercase into ASCII (U+212A, U+0130, U+017F) are an accepted narrowing.

## Historical CPU profile

Profile of the final stage on the real corpus (78.8 MB/s run):

| Share | Component |
|---:|---|
| 23% | the Aho-Corasick DFA scan itself (~370 MB/s through the automaton) |
| 21% | gated rule verification: hand scanners, anchored confirms, residual regexp (~9%) |
| 18% | entropy candidate scoring |
| 16% | GC and copies |
| 10% | memchr (line splitting, anchor candidate hunts) |
| 10% | the hand JSON parse and the fused PII walk |

This profile predates the jsontext walk and direct entropy scorer. Re-profile
the current implementation before choosing another optimization.

## Tried and refuted

Do not re-propose these without new evidence.

- **Separate keyword searches after one ASCII fold.** A simplification experiment
  using `strings.Contains` instead of the automaton made the four synthetic scrub
  benchmarks 3–5x slower. Keeping the automaton with typed nodes retained comparable
  scan throughput, at the cost of more construction memory.
- **Regex search for each rule’s entry literals.** Replacing the literal cursor
  with a compiled keyword alternation preserved every span, but made the ordinary
  and email-heavy 8 MiB benchmarks 2.5–3x slower. Keep literal search; only the
  Unicode prefix comparison delegates to `strings.EqualFold`.
- **One merged alternation regex.** Measured 1.38 MB/s against 2.24 for
  separate regexes and 7.78 for the prefiltered ladder. The Pike VM pays per
  live NFA state per byte; a 28-way union keeps most branches alive at every
  position, forfeits the literal-prefix skip, and disqualifies the fast
  small-pattern engines. The one-scan idea won one layer down instead: the
  automaton is the single DFA pass, built over literals where a DFA is cheap.
- **Unicode folding in the prefilter.** Added after a review found a secret
  missed via U+212A folding into the k of "token", then removed as the accepted
  narrowing above.
- **Window-scoped regex execution.** Superseded by literal anchoring, which
  reaches the same goal with a per-rule soundness derivation instead of
  window-size heuristics.
- **sync.Pool scratch reuse.** Redaction-identical but its arena release
  cleared the whole retained slab on every call: a verified 5x regression once
  one wide record had grown the arena. The JSON tokenizer captured most of the
  allocation win without the hazard.
- **Anchoring `private-key-block`.** Its unbounded lazy tail made candidate
  verification quadratic (up to 481x on a flood of unterminated PEM headers).
  The corpus marks that rule `"sweep": true`; a regression test pins the decision.

## Verification record

- Differential replay against the previous stage and against baseline at every
  stage, comparing output bytes and the full ledger (BytesRedacted, ScanMode,
  LinesParsed, LinesRawScanned, RuleHits), each output re-scrubbed once for
  idempotency: 110k, 190k and 671k end-to-end pairs at the three composition
  points, zero divergence, all 27 rule ids exercised.
- Rule-level exhaustive sweeps: 62.7M values for the card-pan chain
  derivation, ~9.7M for email, 31M-execution fuzz on the JSON tokenizer's
  acceptance set, plus real-transcript replays of 916 MB, 1.7 GB and 1.51 GB
  in the independent reviews.
- Harnesses were mutation-tested (8 of 9 injected scanner bugs caught, the
  ninth provably equivalent) and negative-controlled (two deliberate sabotages
  initially escaped; the corpora were strengthened until both were caught).
- `make check` and `go test -race` green at every commit.

## Standing invariants

- Every fast path keeps its oracle in-repo: the stdlib decoder loop, the
  reference regexes and the sweep matcher survive as test-only references with
  differential tests. Deleting one of those tests removes the only thing
  holding a fast path to its specification.
- `jsonwalk_test.go` compares JSON acceptance with `encoding/json.Valid` and
  checks source preservation, duplicate keys, invalid UTF-8 and dirty strings.
- The anchor derivation table is pinned per rule, so a corpus edit that
  changes a rule's execution path shows up as a visible test diff.
- Config surface: negative `EntropyConfig.MinLength` and empty or non-ASCII
  corpus keywords are loud construction errors. Non-ASCII configured key names
  keep working exactly as before (the key-name gate falls back to always-run).

## Reproducing

```sh
# real-data throughput; skips when the variable is unset, so CI never touches
# private data
SCRUB_BENCH_DIR=$HOME/.claude/projects \
  go test ./internal/transforms/ -bench BenchmarkScrubRealData -benchmem -run '^$' -benchtime 1x

# portable synthetic proxy
go test ./internal/transforms/ -bench BenchmarkScrubSynthetic -benchmem -run '^$'
```

Measurement rules that made the numbers comparable: freeze the corpus before
comparing anything, run benchmarks strictly serially, and interleave old/new
runs when A/B-ing so machine drift shows up as spread rather than as a result.
