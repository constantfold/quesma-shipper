# Architecture

This document describes the module's shape and the reasoning behind it. It is intent,
written for humans; the placement rules below are conventions to follow in review, not
checks a tool runs.

## Shape

**The tree is the architecture.** Packages are named for pipeline responsibilities, and the
shipper's one-sentence description maps onto the directory listing: everything the product
does is one pipeline (read from sources, transform, upload) pumped by one engine, invoked by
three triggers that differ only in *when*.

```
quesma-shipper/
  src/                    Go module root
    cmd/quesma-shipper/   main
    app/                  the facade: resolve config into a run, flush it — the one public package
    packaging/            install, update, service lifecycle; thin current-OS dispatch
      common/             TUF verification, re-exec, shared service types
      macos/              app/pkg assets, launchd, app-bundle update and removal
      linux/              systemd user service
      windows/            Inno Setup assets and per-user Task Scheduler integration
    internal/
      cli/                cobra verbs and rendering — formats, never decides
      config/             policy: the layer merge, the authority rulebook, the served document
      identity/           who this install is: the Unit (install id, age keys, name_key), mint-once, 0600
      engine/             the pump: discover → detect change → read → transform → upload → commit.
                          Owns the upload port, the fingerprint state and the heartbeat.
      sources/            WHAT to read and HOW: catalog resolution, gather, deny, pathexp
        sqliteread/       live agent databases; the sqlite dependency stops here
      transforms/         what changes between read and write: scrub → enrich → seal
        packs/            the compiled redaction rule packs (data, importable by config)
        cursorjoin/       the Cursor enricher
      upload/             the presigned PUT: origin allowlist, exact-key validation, net/http
                          and nothing else. No cloud SDK exists in this module.
      controlplane/       everything that speaks to the control plane, regardless of verb:
                          the enroll call, the config fetch, upload authorization, the
                          enrollment record
      platform/           the inert floor, one stated invariant each: atomic writes (safeio),
                          the kill switch (pause), memstat, buildinfo
      legal/              the embedded LICENSE, NOTICE and third-party license texts
      formats/            the shared vocabulary: local-contract schemas, the model types,
                          the object-key naming grammar (+ its conformance vectors)
        catalogdata/      the embedded source-catalog YAML
```

Paths in this document are relative to the repository root. The Go module begins at `src/`,
so Go import paths omit that filesystem prefix.

## Reading a collection run

Start at `app/flush.go`, which turns resolved policy into `engine.Options`. The engine
then owns this sequence:

```
config.Resolve → app.Runtime.Flush → engine.Run
  sources.Discover → sourcePass.run → prepareFile → authorizeAndUpload → commit
                                      scrub → seal
  staged raw units → enrichSource → scrub → seal → upload → commit
  report → heartbeat
```

The main files name the decisions they own:

| Concern | Files under `src/` |
| --- | --- |
| Configuration order, merge, validation, roots | `internal/config/{resolve,merge,validate,roots}.go` |
| Discovery, traversal, lazy reads, format probes | `internal/sources/{gather,walk,sniff_file}.go` |
| SQLite read fallbacks and scoped, filtered queries | `internal/sources/sqliteread/sqliteread.go` |
| Run policy and per-source collection | `internal/engine/{engine,collect}.go` |
| Admission and concurrency | `internal/engine/pool.go` |
| Ordered outcomes and durable commits | `internal/engine/{outcome,commitbuffer}.go` |
| State ownership and disk representation | `internal/engine/{state,state_wire}.go` |
| Scrub orchestration and replacement plans | `internal/transforms/{scrub,redaction}.go` |
| Cursor alignment, evidence ranking, argument comparison | `internal/transforms/cursorjoin/{align,match,args}.go` |
| Tick judgement and failure persistence | `app/{judge,failure_record}.go` |
| Diagnostic agent summaries, source details, history | `app/diagnose_{agents,sources,history}.go` |

`sources.Discover` dispatches to the compiled collectors. Enrichers use an ID-to-implementation
map populated by the app and shared with diagnostics. Raw and derived files both produce a
`fileResult` that carries its ciphertext and the fingerprint to commit; only the source
coordinator commits it, after the destination confirms the write, and clears the ciphertext.
The audit logger accepts nil as disabled, allowing preview to use the same pipeline.

Import direction follows the table below: **every internal edge is declared, package by
package.** Go's compiler bans cycles, not wrong-direction edges: `transforms → engine`
would compile, so the table is the reference for what direction is intended.

| `src/internal/upload` | — |
| `src/packaging` | `src/internal/platform`, `src/packaging/common`, and the current OS package (`src/packaging/macos` or `src/packaging/linux`) |
| `src/packaging/common` | `src/internal/platform` |
| `src/packaging/macos` | `src/internal/platform`, `src/packaging/common` |
| `src/packaging/linux` | `src/internal/platform`, `src/packaging/common` |

Banned by name, with the temptation each forestalls:

- `src/internal/sources → src/internal/engine` — a stage feeds the pump; it does not reach back into it
- `src/internal/transforms → src/internal/engine` — a stage feeds the pump; it does not reach back into it
- `src/internal/platform → src/internal/*` — the floor is inert: network-capable chokepoints are sub-packages, not dependencies

Two edges deserve prose because they look like mistakes and are the design:

- **`src/app` is the only package importing both `src/internal/controlplane` and
  `src/internal/upload`.** The engine
  declares the port (`UploadPort`, `PreparedObject`) and is handed an
  implementation; the ticket, the URL and every wire type stop in `src/app/`, which is why the
  loop cannot learn that a control plane exists.
- **`src/internal/controlplane → src/internal/config`**: the served document is config's format to parse; the
  alternative is a second implementation of the same document.

## The invariants that outrank the tree

These are checked by tests or held in review, because no directory layout can express them:

- **Fail-closed scrub**: a scrub error means the file does not upload. Scrub and seal are
  mandatory pipeline steps in every build; no config layer can remove them.
- **Write-path lint** (`src/internal/platform/writepath_lint_test.go`): only the packages (and,
  inside merged packages, the specific *files*) that own a durable artifact may call the
  os-level write functions; everything else routes through safeio. The shipper never writes
  inside an agent's store.
- **Third-party confinement**: an SDK stops in the package that owns it — sqlite never
  past sqliteread. No AWS, Azure or Google client is linked into the shipped binary
  (the `-tags perf` harness in `src/perf` is the sole importer of the S3 SDK, as a test
  peer): the only route to object storage is a presigned ticket spent over `net/http`,
  and a credential this binary never holds cannot be misdirected. `go list -deps
  ./cmd/quesma-shipper` is the check that nothing from the harness reaches the binary.
- **Surface caps**: platform and formats are importable from everywhere, so their
  exported surfaces stay small; growth there is a decision, not an accident.

## Placement heuristic

Ask **which verb makes this code run**:

- during `sync`/`run` → it is a pipeline concern: a stage (`sources`, `transforms`,
  `upload`), the pump (`engine`), policy (`config`), or the wire client (`controlplane`).
- installation, update, service registration, or removal → `src/packaging/`; reusable policy goes
  in `src/packaging/common/`, OS mechanisms beside their installer assets.
- in every build regardless of verb, with one stated invariant → `src/internal/platform/`.
- it describes data at rest or on the wire → `src/internal/formats/`.
- it composes a run → `src/app/`. It renders → `src/internal/cli/`.

One deliberate exception: `src/internal/controlplane/` is organized by *counterparty*, not by verb — the
enroll call (setup-time) lives beside the fetch and the upload authorization (sync-time)
because they share one wire contract, pinned by `src/internal/controlplane/wire_contract_test.go`
against the schemas and fixtures embedded in the shipper-protocol module.

## History

The first generation of this file described the same invariants as eight pattern-role layers
(contract → platform → domain → ports → core → adapters → app → cli) over 37 packages,
enforced by a layer map and an exception ratchet. The 2026-08 pipeline-tree migration merged
the packages into the tree above and replaced the layer machinery with the per-edge
allowlist; the invariants themselves — zero-network, fail-closed scrub, write-path
discipline, dependency confinement — moved unchanged. The design discussion and migration
plan were recorded separately in the old repository and were not copied here.

Account collectors use bounded provider HTTP reads during collection only. Credentials stay
in memory; a separate exact-key SQLite reader supplies Cursor authentication without changing
the generic collection deny rules. macOS Keychain access invokes only `/usr/bin/security find-generic-password` with a five-second
timeout, using the system reader’s existing permissions.
Account discovery returns a bucket filename; `Candidate.Load` fetches its content only
after the engine checks upload state. Successful uploads skip later fetches in that bucket.
Filesystem reads use the same loading method. Account catalog entries set `scrub: false`;
encryption and upload use the normal pipeline. Sources do not import transforms or engine.
